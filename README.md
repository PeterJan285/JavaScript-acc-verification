## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

- In this project I learn how to make numbers appear consecutively in the highlighted boxes when typed and also disappear when erased. 

- This is a form for confirming your identity through receiving a set of numbers required to be typed into the form. It is used for websites such as Paypal and others

Thanks for checking out my JS learning projects.
